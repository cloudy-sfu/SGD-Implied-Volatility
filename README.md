## Introduction

In this paper, a new numerical method based on adaptive gradient descent optimizers is provided for computing the implied volatility from the Black-Scholes (B-S) option pricing model. It is shown that the new method is more accurate than the close form approximation. Compared with the Newton-Raphson method, the new method obtains a reliable rate of convergence and tends to be less sensitive to the beginning point.

## Functions

The European call option pricing model on a stock as follows

$$
\begin{split}
 &   s\Phi(d_1) - ke^{-rt}\Phi(d_2) = c \\
 &   d_1 = \frac{\ln{\frac{s}{k}} + (r + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)t}{\sigma\sqrt{t}} \\
 &   d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{t},
\end{split}
$$

where $\sigma$ is the volatility, $s$ is the corresponding spot price, $k$ is the strike price, $r$ is the risk-free interest rate, $c$ is the price of the call option, $t$ is the time of maturity, and $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of standard normal distribution up to $x$ i.e.

$$
\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{x}e^{-\frac{\tau^2}{2}}\mathrm{d}\tau.
$$

All parameters except $\sigma$ can be obtained directly from market
data of the B-S equation. This enables a market-based estimation of a call option's future volatility. Implied volatility can be estimated by the inverse use of B-S equation, which infers $\sigma$ from the market price of the call option.

The numerical approximation of implied volatility from B-S formula is to find the root of

$$
g(\sigma) = s\Phi(d_1) - ke^{-rt}\Phi(d_2) - c = 0.
$$

The numerical approximation $g(\sigma)$ can be transformed into solving an optimization problem

$$
\min_\sigma h(\sigma) = (s\Phi(d_1) - ke^{-rt}\Phi(d_2)-c)^2.
$$

We use adaptive gradient descent optimizer to solve this problem.

## Usage

Dataset: `data/CallOptionBSM.xlsx`

Data pre-processing: `data_pre_processing.py`

The following files are for solving $h(\sigma)$ with different methods:

- `mdl_newton.py`:  Newton-Raphson method
- `mdl_miller.py`:  Corrado-Miller formula
- `mdl_adam.py`:  Adaptive gradient descent method with "Adam" optimizer
- `mdl_adabelief.py`:  Adaptive gradient descent method with "Adabelief" optimizer

The following files are for drawing statistical figures:

- `fig_iter_history.py`: show MAE sequence during the iterative process
- `fig_sigma_distribution_miller.py`: show a histogram of Ïƒ estimated with Corrado-Miller formula
- `fig_compare_convergence.py`: select some results to compare NC and MAE metrics

All results are saved in `results` folder.
